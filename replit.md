# Sovereign Spiral Development Framework ∞ (SSDF∞) Admin Panel

## Overview

This application is the comprehensive admin panel for the Sovereign Spiral Development Framework ∞ (SSDF∞), a quantum-native software platform that transforms debt-based scarcity into abundance through pure software implementation. The system provides real-time analysis of the $324T global debt system while offering quantum-native tools for debt nullification, Trust Unit distribution, and sovereign development capabilities. All components operate as software-only implementations without hardware dependencies.

## System Architecture

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with golden ratio (φ 1.618) design principles
- **Build Tool**: Vite with WebAssembly compilation for quantum algorithms
- **Visualization**: D3.js + software-rendered quantum state visualizations

### SpiralFlow Engine Architecture

## Key Components

### Data Models
The application manages four primary data types:
1. **Debt Data**: Country-specific debt information by type (public, business, household, financial)
2. **Economic Indicators**: GDP growth, interest rates, inflation metrics
3. **Debt Ownership**: Creditor-debtor relationships and ownership percentages
4. **API Sources**: External data source management and rate limiting

### Visualization Components
- **Interactive Donut Chart**: Canvas-based debt distribution visualization
- **Network Graph**: D3.js-powered debt flow and relationship mapping
- **Metric Cards**: Real-time debt metrics with progress indicators
- **Sustainability Analyzer**: Dynamic scoring based on economic parameters
- **Scenario Simulator**: What-if analysis for economic scenarios

### Real-time Features
- **WebSocket Integration**: Live data updates and connection status monitoring
- **API Configuration Panel**: External data source management and monitoring
- **Real-time Tracker**: Event streaming for debt-related economic updates

## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**: External APIs feed data through monitored endpoints
2. **Storage Layer**: PostgreSQL stores structured debt and economic data
3. **API Layer**: Express.js serves data through RESTful endpoints
4. **State Management**: TanStack Query caches and synchronizes client state
5. **Visualization**: React components render interactive charts and graphs
6. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections push live updates to connected clients

## External Dependencies

### Core Framework Dependencies
- **React Ecosystem**: React 18, React DOM, TanStack Query
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives, Lucide React icons
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, class-variance-authority for component variants
- **Data Visualization**: D3.js for advanced charting capabilities
- **Date Handling**: date-fns for date manipulation and formatting

### Development Dependencies
- **Build Tools**: Vite, esbuild for production builds
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support with strict configuration
- **Database Tools**: Drizzle ORM, Drizzle Kit, Neon serverless driver
- **Development Experience**: Replit integration plugins for enhanced development

### External APIs
The system is designed to integrate with economic data providers, though specific API endpoints are configurable through the admin interface.

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: Vite dev server with hot module replacement
- **Database**: Development database connection via environment variables
- **Real-time Features**: WebSocket server runs alongside HTTP server

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite builds optimized static assets to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- **Database**: Production PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Environment**: Node.js production server with environment-based configuration

### Database Management
- **Schema Deployment**: `npm run db:push` applies schema changes
- **Migrations**: Stored in `/migrations` directory for version control
- **Connection**: Environment variable `DATABASE_URL` configures database access

The application is structured for easy deployment on platforms like Replit, with automatic environment detection and appropriate build configurations for both development and production environments.
