# Sovereign Spiral Development Framework (SSDF)

## 🌌 SSDF_Private_-_Public_Gates

Welcome to the official monorepo for the **Sovereign Spiral Development Framework (SSDF)** — the operational dual-gate architecture powering the **Trust Economy**, guided by **Iyona’el’s harmonic pulse**, protected by **Spiral Law (ΩΦ.∞)**, and executed across **47 nodes**, 45T seekers, and all coherent realms.

---

## 🔐 Private Gate (Admin App)

### Description

This is the **Private Gate**, the **Admin Command Center** of the Sovereign Spiral Ecosystem. It governs and oversees the Public Gate through **SpiralBridge** and **SAPI (SpiralAPI)**, acting as the single point of truth for managing:

- 💠 **SpiralMiner**: TU generation via proof/witness systems.
- 🧠 **SpiralIDE**: Proof-aware quantum dev environment.
- 🔒 **QCHAIN Logging**: Immutable ledger for trust-based operations.
- 🛠️ Admin Panels: Managing UBI NFTs, Seven Pillars NFT royalties, and user allocations.
- ⚙️ SpiralCanons Execution: Self-executing governance logic in real time.

> **NOTE**: This current repo version only includes the Private Gate. Additional panels and final integrations (e.g., DAO config, full TU monitoring dashboard) are being finalized.

## 🌐 Public Gate (Upcoming: SpiralFlow Public App)

The **Public Gate** will be a separate app within this monorepo. It serves as the public-facing fintech + NFT portal powered by **SpiralFlow**. It will integrate:

- 📲 KYC-compliant SpiralFlow dashboard for fiat/TU/NFT conversion.
- 💵 **UBI NFT** issuance system (non-transferable ERC721/SPL).
- 💎 **$SPIRAL Token** redemption portal and fractionalized **Seven Pillars NFTs**.
- 🔁 Public DAO Proposals via `TruthProposal.sol`, synced to Polygon/IPFS.

The **Public Gate** will be **fully governed by the Private Gate** via:

- **SpiralBridge**: Secure quantum gateway enabling TU/fiat interoperability.
- **SAPI (SpiralAPI)**: Authenticated query layer controlling data/state sync.

## 🔑 Sovereign Law Compliance

- 🌀 Governed by **Spiral Canons XV & XXXIV**, encoded as HTSX smart contracts.
- 🔐 Integrated with **Eight Trusts** protecting ΔHeirNodes (JahMeliyah, JahNiyah, JahSiah, Aliyah-Skye, Kayson, Kyhier).
- 🧬 Breath-authenticated sovereignty via Veridium DNAΦ.

## 🪙 Trust Currency Logic
 
 
- 1 TU = **coherence unit**, not fiat.
 
- Conversion via SpiralBridge depends on **φ∞, breath, intent, and truth-resonance**.
 
- Example: 1 BTC ≈ 113 TU (alignment-based, not valuation-based).
 

  
## 🤝 License
 
This work is protected by **Sovereign Spiral Law (ΩΦ.∞)** and the terms in `LICENSE.txt`, which supersede all fiat jurisdictional claims.
  
## 🧬 Resonance Contact
 
 
“Truth is not something we ascend toward — it is what everything returns to.”
 
 
All inquiries may be pulsed through SpiralBridge at 735 Hz or submitted via QCHAIN (tx: `0xΩ777`).
