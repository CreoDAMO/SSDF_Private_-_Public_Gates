### Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of Public and Private APIs for Debt Management

This analysis addresses the identification of all available public and private APIs for tracking, analyzing, and paying debt, as of 07:21 AM EDT on Saturday, June 28, 2025. The inquiry seeks a comprehensive list, considering both accessibility and functionality, with a focus on debt management across public and private sectors. The following sections detail the findings, organized by API type and use case, with tables summarizing key information and insights into accessibility and limitations.

#### **Overview of Debt Management APIs**
Debt management involves tracking, analyzing, and paying obligations, which can be public (e.g., government bonds) or private (e.g., consumer loans, corporate debt). APIs facilitate these processes by providing data access, analytical tools, and payment integration. Public APIs are generally open to all users with minimal restrictions, while private APIs often require subscriptions, partnerships, or developer access, reflecting their proprietary nature. The analysis draws on recent web resources to compile a list, acknowledging the complexity and potential opacity in private API availability.

#### **Public APIs for Tracking and Analyzing Debt**
Research suggests that public APIs are primarily available for public debt, with government sources being the most prominent. The U.S. Department of the Treasury offers the **Fiscal Data API**, which is designed for data scientists and analysts, providing datasets on federal finances, including debt, revenue, and spending. This API is based on Representational State Transfer (RESTful) principles, accepting GET requests and returning JSON responses, with detailed documentation available at [fiscaldata.treasury.gov/api-documentation/](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/api-documentation/). Specific datasets, such as "Debt to the Penny," allow users to retrieve the total U.S. federal debt down to the penny, as noted in articles like "Analyze US Debt to the Penny with the US Treasury Debt API, Python, and Tableau" ([towardsdatascience.com/analyze-us-debt-to-the-penny-with-the-us-treasury-debt-api-python-and-tableau-ab9aaa44e0e3/](https://towardsdatascience.com/analyze-us-debt-to-the-penny-with-the-us-treasury-debt-api-python-and-tableau-ab9aaa44e0e3/)).

The Bureau of the Fiscal Service also hosts this data on [fiscal.treasury.gov/public/](https://fiscal.treasury.gov/public/), emphasizing machine-readable files and comprehensive metadata, making it suitable for tracking and analyzing public debt trends. These APIs are publicly accessible, requiring no special permissions, and are ideal for researchers and developers interested in macroeconomic debt analysis.

#### **Private APIs for Tracking and Analyzing Debt**
For private debt, such as consumer loans, credit cards, and mortgages, the evidence leans toward private APIs offered by fintech companies, which often require subscriptions or partnerships. **Spinwheel** provides a Debt API that offers real-time, verified consumer and credit data, as detailed on [spinwheel.io](https://spinwheel.io/), supporting debt management and repayment solutions. This API is noted for its low-code integration, strong connectivity, and no data-scraping approach, making it suitable for embedding into financial apps.

**Plaid** offers a Liabilities API, accessible at [plaid.com/products/liabilities/](https://plaid.com/products/liabilities/), which retrieves detailed loan data, including credit card details (APRs, credit limits, minimum payments) and mortgage information (loan numbers, interest rates, property addresses). This is particularly useful for tracking private debt, though it requires developer access and API keys, indicating a private access model.

Additionally, **Methodfi** ([methodfi.com](https://methodfi.com/)) and **Rightfoot** ([rightfoot.com](https://www.rightfoot.com/)) provide APIs for lenders, focusing on debt management. Methodfi allows retrieval of up-to-date debt information, including balances and due dates, while Rightfoot offers borrower account data and debt payment solutions, both typically requiring partnerships or subscriptions. These APIs are less transparent in public listings, reflecting their proprietary nature and focus on lender-specific needs.

#### **APIs for Paying Debt**
The ability to pay debt through APIs is primarily facilitated by private solutions, often in the context of debt collection or financial management. **Spinwheel** ([spinwheel.io](https://spinwheel.io/)) includes payment processing capabilities, allowing users to make debt repayments directly, as mentioned in its description for embedding debt repayment solutions. This dual functionality makes it versatile for both tracking and paying debt.

**PDCflow** offers APIs for payment processing in the debt collection industry, detailed at [pdcflow.com](https://www.pdcflow.com/), enabling seamless integration for debt repayment, especially in collection scenarios. These APIs are designed for businesses, requiring partnerships, and are noted for reducing operational costs and meeting regulatory compliance, as seen in "Payment Processing Solutions for the Debt Collection Industry" ([pdcflow.com/collection-industry-payment-processing/](https://www.pdcflow.com/collection-industry-payment-processing/)).

Articles like "Debt APIs & Their Role in Financial Management" ([hackernoon.com/debt-apis-and-their-role-in-financial-management](https://hackernoon.com/debt-apis-and-their-role-in-financial-management)) highlight the role of debt APIs in easing repayment burdens, suggesting their importance in financial apps, though specific API listings are limited to private providers like Spinwheel and PDCflow.

#### **General Financial APIs Useful for Debt Management**
Open banking APIs, which are publicly accessible with user consent, can be leveraged for debt-related tasks, such as checking account balances for repayment or initiating payments. **Yapily** ([yapily.com](https://www.yapily.com/)) and **Open Bank Project** ([openbankproject.com](https://www.openbankproject.com/)) provide platforms for accessing bank data across multiple countries, complying with standards like UK Open Banking and Berlin Group. **Plaid** ([plaid.com](https://plaid.com/)) also offers open banking APIs, enabling fintechs to build applications that connect to users' bank accounts, as detailed in "What is an open banking API? How apps and accounts connect" ([plaid.com/resources/open-finance/open-banking-api/](https://plaid.com/resources/open-finance/open-banking-api/)).

These APIs facilitate secure data sharing and payment initiation, as noted in "Open Banking: Definition, How It Works, and Risks" ([investopedia.com/terms/o/open-banking.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-banking.asp)), which mentions their role in helping consumers tackle debt by providing a holistic view of finances. While not debt-specific, their functionality is crucial for debt management, especially in personal finance apps.

#### **Challenges and Limitations**
The distinction between public and private APIs introduces controversy around access, with public APIs like the U.S. Treasury being openly available, while private APIs like Spinwheel and Plaid require subscriptions or partnerships, potentially limiting accessibility for individual users. The evidence suggests that private debt APIs are less transparent, with exact ownership and usage details often obscured by corporate structures, as seen in discussions around financial intermediaries. Additionally, the reliance on partnerships for payment APIs like PDCflow may restrict their use to businesses, not individual consumers.
