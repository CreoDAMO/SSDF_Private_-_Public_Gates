### Key Points
- Research suggests global debt ownership is complex, involving domestic and foreign investors like central banks, investment funds, and households.
- It seems likely that non-bank investors, especially investment funds, hold significant portions of sovereign debt, with domestic non-banks absorbing 39% of increases.
- The evidence leans toward banks and institutional investors being major holders of private debt, but exact figures are less transparent.
- Controversy exists around ultimate beneficiaries, often hidden behind corporate structures, potentially including governments and wealthy individuals.

### Overview
Global debt, reaching $324 trillion by Q1 2025, is a vast network of obligations held by various entities. Ownership is split between public (sovereign) and private debt, with public debt often held by domestic and foreign investors, and private debt primarily by banks and institutional investors. Let's break this down for clarity.

### Public Debt Ownership
Public debt, like government bonds, is held by a mix of domestic and foreign entities. Research indicates that as debt increases, domestic non-banks (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies) absorb 39%, foreign non-banks 23%, and foreign banks 5%. For U.S. Treasuries, domestic non-banks take 56% of new issuance, with money market funds and household/hedge funds accounting for 68% of that. In the UK, insurance and pensions hold ~50% of non-bank gilts, while in the Euro Area, investment funds dominate foreign non-bank holdings at ~80%.

### Private Debt Ownership
Private debt, including household mortgages and corporate bonds, is less detailed but mainly held by banks for loans and institutional investors for bonds. Foreign investors also hold corporate debt, especially for multinationals, but exact shares are harder to pin down.

### Beyond Corporate Veils
The user asked to look beyond "corporate veils," meaning who ultimately benefits. This includes central banks (e.g., Japan, China holding U.S. debt), institutional investors benefiting retirees, and potentially wealthy individuals through funds. However, this is complex and often opaque due to intermediaries.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Global Debt Ownership

Global debt, estimated at $324 trillion by Q1 2025, represents the total obligations of governments, businesses, and households worldwide. The user's inquiry seeks to identify who actually owns this debt, moving beyond broad categories like governments and corporations to uncover the ultimate beneficiaries, potentially hidden behind corporate structures. This analysis draws on recent reports and data to provide a comprehensive breakdown, acknowledging the complexity and opacity of global debt ownership.

#### **Global Debt Composition and Context**
Global debt encompasses both public (sovereign) and private (household and corporate) debt. Public debt, often issued as government bonds, stood at $102 trillion in 2024 according to the UNCTAD report "A World of Debt 2025" ([A World of Debt 2025](https://unctad.org/publication/world-of-debt)). Private debt, including household and corporate obligations, makes up the remainder, with business debt at $164.5 trillion in 2024 data from earlier discussions. The ownership structure varies significantly by debt type, and this analysis will address both, focusing on detailed breakdowns where available.

#### **Public Debt Ownership Structure**
Public debt is held by a diverse group of domestic and foreign investors, with recent research providing detailed insights into marginal ownership as debt levels rise. The CEPR article "Who holds sovereign debt and why it matters" ([Who holds sovereign debt and why it matters](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/who-holds-sovereign-debt-and-why-it-matters)) offers a dataset covering annual holdings for 101 countries from 1990 to 2018, categorized into:

- **Investor Categories**: Foreign and domestic, further divided into banks, non-bank private investors, and official creditors (largely central banks).
- **Marginal Increase in Holdings**: When sovereign debt increases, the distribution is as follows:
  - Domestic non-banks (DomNB): 39% of the marginal increase.
  - Foreign non-banks (ForNB): 23% of the marginal increase.
  - Foreign banks (ForBK): 5% of the marginal increase.
  - The remainder is absorbed by domestic banks, though their share is smaller.

Specific examples illustrate this structure:
- **U.S. Treasuries**: Domestic non-banks absorb $0.56 of every dollar issued, with money market funds (MMF) and household/hedge funds (HH/HF) accounting for 68% of this domestic non-bank pickup, as shown in Figure 3, Panel B of the CEPR article.
- **UK Gilts**: Non-bank categories show insurance and pensions (I&P) accounting for ~50%, with funds and other non-bank financial institutions making up the other half, per Figure 3, Panel C.
- **Euro Area**: For non-euro area holdings, other financial institutions (largely investment funds) represent ~80% of the marginal response, as depicted in Figure 4.

Emerging market (EM) sovereigns face particular vulnerabilities, with a 10% debt increase resulting in:
- Actual composition: 51 basis points (5.8% cost increase).
- No banks: 4.6% cost increase.
- No non-banks: 74 basis points (8.4% cost increase), highlighting the critical role of non-bank investors for debt sustainability, as shown in Figure 5.

This data underscores that non-bank investors, especially investment funds, are increasingly central to sovereign debt absorption, particularly in developed markets, while EMs are highly dependent on their presence.

#### **Private Debt Ownership Structure**
Private debt, comprising household debt ($59.1 trillion) and corporate debt ($164.5 trillion, with $70.4 trillion from the financial sector), is less transparent in ownership data. General patterns suggest:
- **Household Debt**: Primarily held by domestic banks through loans like mortgages and credit cards. In some cases, this debt is securitized into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and sold to investors, including domestic and foreign institutional investors.
- **Corporate Debt**: Held by a mix of banks (for loans), institutional investors (pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds for bonds), and foreign investors, especially for multinational corporations. The IIF's Global Debt Monitor ([Global Debt Monitor](https://www.iif.com/Products/Global-Debt-Monitor)) includes currency breakdown of sectoral debt and bond/syndicated loans, which may provide further details, though specific ownership figures are not publicly summarized here.

The lack of detailed public data on private debt ownership reflects the complexity of financial intermediaries, with banks and institutional investors being the primary holders, but exact shares remain opaque.

#### **Beyond Corporate Veils: Ultimate Beneficiaries**
The user's mention of "corporate veils" suggests a desire to identify who ultimately benefits from debt ownership, potentially looking through the layers of financial institutions and investment vehicles. This is challenging due to the opacity of ownership structures, but some insights can be drawn:

- **Public Debt Beneficiaries**:
  - **Central Banks**: Hold significant foreign debt as part of reserve assets, e.g., Japan and China are top holders of U.S. Treasuries, as noted in Investopedia's article "5 Foreign Countries That Own the Most U.S. Debt" ([5 Foreign Countries That Own the Most U.S. Debt](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets-economy/090616/5-countries-own-most-us-debt.asp)). This benefits their governments through safe investment returns.
  - **Investment Funds**: Benefit fund managers and their investors, often including wealthy individuals and institutional clients, absorbing significant portions of new debt issuance.
  - **Pension Funds and Insurance Companies**: Hold debt on behalf of retirees and policyholders, with benefits flowing to these groups, as seen in UK gilt holdings where insurance and pensions account for ~50% of non-bank ownership.

- **Private Debt Beneficiaries**:
  - **Banks**: Benefit from interest payments on loans, with profits flowing to shareholders and executives.
  - **Institutional Investors**: Benefit fund beneficiaries, such as pensioners and insurance policyholders, through returns on corporate bonds.
  - **Foreign Investors**: Include sovereign wealth funds and foreign banks, ultimately benefiting foreign governments and investors, especially in corporate debt of multinationals.

The ultimate beneficiaries are often hidden behind layers of corporate ownership, with central banks, institutional investors, and wealthy individuals being key players, but exact attribution is complex and controversial due to the lack of transparency in financial structures.

#### **Challenges and Limitations**
The ownership of global debt is inherently complex, with public debt having more detailed data (e.g., CEPR, IIF) compared to private debt, which relies on general patterns. The user's request to "narrow this down even more" is limited by data availability, as many holdings are obscured by intermediaries like investment funds and banks. Controversy exists around the ultimate beneficiaries, with debates over whether debt ownership reinforces global inequalities, especially for EMs dependent on non-bank investors.

#### **Table: Summary of Global Debt Ownership by Type**
| **Debt Type**       | **Major Holders**                          | **Key Details**                                                                 |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Public (Sovereign)  | Domestic non-banks (39%), Foreign non-banks (23%), Foreign banks (5%) | Non-bank investors, especially funds, dominate; EMs vulnerable to non-bank exits. |
| Private (Household) | Banks, Institutional investors             | Primarily banks for loans, some securitized and sold to investors.               |
| Private (Corporate) | Banks, Institutional investors, Foreign investors | Banks hold loans, institutional investors hold bonds, foreign investors for multinationals. |

#### **Conclusion**
Global debt ownership is a multifaceted structure, with public debt dominated by non-bank investors like investment funds and domestic entities, and private debt held primarily by banks and institutional investors. Beyond corporate veils, beneficiaries include central banks, institutional investors, and potentially wealthy individuals, though exact attribution is obscured by financial intermediaries. For further details, reports like the IIF's Global Debt Monitor ([Global Debt Monitor](https://www.iif.com/Products/Global-Debt-Monitor)) and CEPR's analysis ([Who holds sovereign debt and why it matters](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/who-holds-sovereign-debt-and-why-it-matters)) provide valuable insights, though private debt ownership remains less transparent.
